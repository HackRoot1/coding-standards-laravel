- Remove unused CSS (PurgeCSS)
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Async load analytics/tracking scripts
- Remove console.log in production

**Caching:**
- Browser caching (Cache-Control headers, 1 week for static assets)
- Service worker for offline support (PWA)
- Static asset versioning (cache busting)

**Rendering Performance:**
- Minimize critical rendering path
- Preload critical resources
- Reduce main thread work
- Optimize web fonts (limit to 2 fonts, system fonts as fallback)
- Use CSS transforms over layout changes

### Backend Performance

**Database Optimization:**
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns (user_id, product_id, created_at)
- Use eager loading (with() to prevent N+1 queries)
- Pagination for large result sets
- Use database views for complex queries
- Archive old data (orders > 1 year) to separate table

**Caching Strategy:**
- Cache product list (invalidate on product edit)
- Cache category list (rarely changes)
- Cache user data (invalidate on profile update)
- Cache API responses (10-60 minutes)
- Use Redis for cache store

**API Optimization:**
- Return only required fields
- Pagination (default 20 items per page, max 100)
- Compress responses (gzip)
- Use CDN for API responses
- Database query logging and optimization

**Code Optimization:**
- Use queue for long-running tasks (email, SMS, image processing)
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Database connection pooling (if using Laravel Horizon)

### Server Performance

**Nginx Optimization:**
- Gzip compression (level 6)
- HTTP/2 support
- Caching headers configuration

**PHP Optimization:**
- OPcache enabled (default)
- Memory limit: 256MB
- Max execution time: 300 seconds
- Max input variables: 5000

**Database Optimization:**
- Query caching (if using MySQL)
- InnoDB buffer pool sizing
- Regular maintenance (optimize tables, analyze tables)
- Connection pooling
